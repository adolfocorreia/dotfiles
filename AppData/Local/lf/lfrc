## Custom commands ##

# in commands or mappings.

# Command prefixes:
# :  read (default)  builtin/custom command
# $  shell           shell command
# %  shell-pipe      shell command running with the ui
# !  shell-wait      shell command waiting for key press
# &  shell-async     shell command running asynchronously

# Change 'doc' command to use a different pager
cmd doc $lf -doc | bat --plain

# Send selected files to system trash.
cmd trash %recycle-bin %fx%


## Custom mappings ##

map - updir
map D trash
map w $pwsh -NoLogo
